# Face-Recognition

Face recognition technology has become an integral part of modern-day applications, ranging from security systems and mobile device authentication to personalized user experiences. This technology relies on the ability to identify or verify a person from a digital image or video frame, which involves several complex steps including face detection, feature extraction, and matching.

TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, offers powerful tools and libraries to implement face recognition systems efficiently. Leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities allows developers to create robust and scalable face recognition solutions that can be deployed in real-time applications.
